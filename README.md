# Library Wishlist

## About
It works like a todo list for media things (books, cds) you want.
You make a new entry and the script checks if it's available in your local library.
It then returns the availability state of each item in its library branch.

## Issues
- Because there is no proper WorldCat API of my local library, I can only search their catalog via a classic form submit and html parsing.
